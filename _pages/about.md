I'm Chenghao Mo, an undergraduate in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Zhejiang University. Engaged in cutting-edge research with Professor [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) in the AIDB project, I focus on Systems and Compilers for Machine Learning, particularly in optimizing machine learning queries. Passionate about Computer Systems and Machine Learning Applications, I aim to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science in Fall 2024.
