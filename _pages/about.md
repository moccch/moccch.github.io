I'm Chenghao Mo, an undergraduate in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Zhejiang University, with a strong focus on Machine Learning (ML) applications in Computer Systems. I'm currently collaborating with Professor [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) on the [AIDB](https://medium.com/@danieldkang/aidb-analyze-your-unstructured-data-with-sql-up-to-350x-cheaper-2314eda95c73) project, dedicated to enhancing Systems and Compilers for ML models, particularly through optimizing machine learning queries. My goal is to further develop my expertise in this area by pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science starting Fall 2024.
