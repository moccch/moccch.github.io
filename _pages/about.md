I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a strong background in Computer Engineering. My passion lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems, where I focus on developing scalable ML solutions for big data and optimizing algorithms for distributed computing. As an undergraduate research assistant, I worked closely with Professor [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) on the [AIDB project](https://medium.com/@danieldkang/aidb-analyze-your-unstructured-data-with-sql-up-to-350x-cheaper-2314eda95c73). This experience has deepened my commitment to leveraging ML to enhance system efficiency and performance. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research that advances the integration of ML and systems architecture, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computational efficiency and performance.
