I am a Master of Science in Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign(UIUC). My passion lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems, where I focus on developing scalable ML solutions for big data and optimizing algorithms for distributed computing. When I was an undergraduate research assistant, I worked closely with Professor [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) on the [AIDB project](https://medium.com/@danieldkang/aidb-analyze-your-unstructured-data-with-sql-up-to-350x-cheaper-2314eda95c73). This experience has deepened my commitment to leveraging ML to enhance system efficiency and performance. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research that advances the integration of ML and systems architecture, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computational efficiency and performance.

Research Experience
======

**Optimizing Query Efficiency in Unstructured Data Analysis with Machine Learning**  
[AIDB Project](https://medium.com/@danieldkang/aidb-analyze-your-unstructured-data-with-sql-up-to-350x-cheaper-2314eda95c73)  
Supervised by Professor [Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/), [Data and Information System](https://dais.cs.illinois.edu/), UIUC  
*Since May 2023*

- **Innovative Query Optimization Techniques**: Developed an optimized batched method for query caching, integrated Approximate Selection with Guarantees using Proxies algorithm ([SUPG](https://github.com/moccch/supg)), and designed a specialized estimator for approximate aggregation.
- **Rigorous Evaluation and Benchmarking**: Established custom datasets and a comprehensive framework for evaluating the AIDB engine's efficiency and accuracy in querying semantically rich unstructured data.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Implemented advanced data visualization techniques to represent complex query results and performance metrics, enhancing data interpretability.
